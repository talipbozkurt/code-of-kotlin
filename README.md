My Kotlin Learning Journey
Welcome to my Kotlin learning repository! This space is dedicated to my journey of exploring Kotlin and improving my coding skills. Here, you'll find examples, exercises, and code snippets that I find important as I continue to grow as a developer.

Why Kotlin?
Kotlin has proven to be an incredibly versatile and fun language, whether you're building Android applications or working on backend development. I’m committed to learning it deeply, one line of code at a time.

Atomic Commits
As part of my development practice, I emphasize the importance of atomic commits. I make sure each commit represents a single, logical change in the code. This helps in maintaining a clean and manageable version history, making collaboration and debugging much easier.

Key Code Examples
While learning Kotlin, I’ve focused on working through practical examples that helped me understand key concepts. In this repository, you will find code samples that have been particularly impactful in my learning process. These include:

Data handling
Object-oriented principles
